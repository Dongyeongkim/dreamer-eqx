# dreamer-eqx

This is a partial reimplementation of [DreamerV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04104).

The goal of this reimplementation is ...

- to integrate massively parallel environment such as [Craftax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16801).

- to make an accesible baseline to understand and modify DreamerV3 more easily at code-level without losing the context of original code (many lines are just copy & pasted from original code) 


Thanks to flexible JAX based neural networks library [Equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/), It was possible to rewrite the Ninjax code into more readable & sustainable code format.  


**Warning: Reproducing has not been done yet**

**Warning: Do not think this repo as verified reimplementation at current moment. some parts of codes are missing and have some hacky style of code writing, need to be careful to use.**
